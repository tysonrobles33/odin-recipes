    <p>Biscuits and gravy is a meal consisting of butter biscuits topped in sausage gravy, traditionally served as an American breakfast. The exact origins of the meal are unknown
        but many believe that it was started sometime in the revolutionary war, but others debate it wasn't made until the late 1800's in Appalachia.</p>
